1. Abstraction
    1.1 Briefly define the principle.
        -   Abstraction simplifies complex
            systems because it models 
            classes based on essential 
            properties like its attributes 
            and hides unecessary details from 
            other classes.

    1.3 How did using that principle help that program become more flexible for future changes?


2. Encapsulation
    2.1 Briefly define the principle.
        -   This principle bundles code 
            (Like attributes, methods or functions)
            that works together in one class 
            and not letting other parts of a 
            program interfere with it. 
            This is done by utalizing 
            a getter to let someone read 
            a value but not change it,
            or use a setter to check
            if a new value is valid 
            before allowing it.

3. Inheritance
    3.1 Briefly define the principle.
        - Inheritance is where a class 
        has default attributes it
         gained from a parent class. 
        This is done by having a child 
        class extend or inherit from the
        parent class using the ":" symbol.
