/*


Questions im asking myself and writing
 out my thoughts in order to absorb
 more information. 

What am I reading right now? 

I think its something about inheritence
between a parent class and a child class.

Actually,
  I am reading about method overriding. 
Specifically about the ability of a child
class to over write a method it inherited 
from its parent class. 


In this way the method's name stays 
the same but the behavior or the way
 it runs its code changes.
