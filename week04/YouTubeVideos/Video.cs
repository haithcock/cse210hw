/*
Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Add a Method to Video to Get the Number of Comments

Now, we need a method inside Video that returns the number of comments.
üõ† Your Task:

    Inside Video, create a method called GetCommentCount().
    This method should:
        Return an int (the total number of comments in the Comments list).

Hint:

How do you get the size of a List<> in C#? Think about how you'd retrieve the number of items in Comments.
